# Resolve GitHub Issues

Execute issue resolution workflow using isolated worktrees, TDD methodology, and agent collaboration.

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Existing worktrees: !`git worktree list`
- Open issues: !`gh issue list --state open --limit 10`
- GitHub authentication: !`gh auth status`

## Requirements Summary

Use isolated worktrees to avoid disrupting main development. Follow TDD cycle (red → green → refactor) with agent support. Reference issues in commits using auto-closing keywords. See `references/requirements.md` for protected PR workflow and commit standards.

## Phase 1: Issue Selection and Worktree Setup

**Goal**: Select target issue and prepare isolated development environment.

**Actions**:
1. Review open issues from context and select based on priority and `$ARGUMENTS`
2. Check existing worktrees to determine if reuse is possible
3. Create new worktree with descriptive branch name (see `references/workflow-details.md` for naming)
4. Navigate to worktree directory for isolated development
5. Verify issue acceptance criteria and dependencies

## Phase 2: TDD Implementation

**Goal**: Implement fix using test-driven development with agent collaboration.

**Actions**:
1. Plan implementation approach and assess architectural impact
2. Write failing tests that verify issue is resolved (RED phase)
3. Implement minimal code to make tests pass (GREEN phase)
4. Refactor while keeping tests green (REFACTOR phase)
5. Run quality validation commands (see `references/workflow-details.md` for project-specific checks)

## Phase 3: PR Creation and Cleanup

**Goal**: Create pull request, link issue, and clean up worktree after merge.

**Actions**:
1. Push branch to remote with `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
2. Create PR using `gh pr create` with auto-closing keywords (e.g., "Closes #456")
3. Report PR URL and status to user
4. After successful merge: remove worktree and delete local branch
5. Document resolution and any follow-up tasks
